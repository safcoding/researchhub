**Suggestions for Admin UI/UX and Optimization**
1. Filter Components
Reset Button: Good use of a consistent reset button (shadcn/ui Button).
Filter State: Consider using a single object for all filter state in each page for easier resets and updates.
Placeholder Text: Ensure all Selects and Inputs have clear placeholder text for better usability.
Debounce Search Inputs: For text search (e.g., lab name), debounce the input to avoid filtering on every keystroke.

2. Data Fetching & Filtering
Client-Side Filtering: Works well for small/medium datasets. For large datasets, consider server-side filtering or pagination.
Filter Logic: Make sure all filter fields are included in the filtering logic (some pages may only filter by a subset).
Loading/Error States: All pages show loading spinners and error messages, which is good UX.

3. Consistency
Consistent Layout: All admin pages use the same sidebar and header layout, which is excellent for user experience.
Button Placement: "Add" buttons are consistently placed at the top right of each section.
Filter Placement: Filters are always above the table, which is standard and user-friendly.

4. Accessibility
Labels: All form fields and filters have labels, which is good for accessibility.
Keyboard Navigation: Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, selects, inputs) are keyboard accessible.

5. Optimization
Memoization: You are using useMemo for filtered lists, which is good.
Avoid Unnecessary Renders: Make sure filter components only re-render when relevant state changes.
Component Props: Pass only necessary props to child components to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

6. UI/UX Enhancements
Empty State: When no results are found, display a friendly message and possibly a "Clear Filters" button.
Pagination or Infinite Scroll: For large tables, consider adding pagination or infinite scroll.
Bulk Actions: If relevant, allow bulk delete/edit for selected rows in tables.
Responsive Design: Ensure tables and filters are usable on smaller screens.
